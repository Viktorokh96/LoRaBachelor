  abstract  = {The new concept of Industry 4.0 has been developed: it includes both Internet of Things (IoT) structure and the local networks that are still needed to carry out real-time tasks. However, forecasts of mass application of consumer IoT system have stimulated the development of new wireless technologies that may also be interesting for industry. In this paper, the LoRa technology is investigated for the implementation of industrial wireless networks suitable for sensors and actuators of the Industry 4.0 era. After a brief overview of LoRa and LoRaWAN, the paper deals with the discussion about using LoRa for industrial applications compared to traditional industrial wireless systems. With only very light modifications to the upper layer of LoRaWAN communication stack, a time slot channel hopping schema is possible. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach, which is compatible with requirements of soft real-time applications in process industry. In particular, proper time, frequency, and spreading factor planning may allow 6000 nodes accessed up to one minute cycle time.},

  abstract      = {Low power wide area (LPWA) networks are making spectacular progress from design, standardization, to commercialization. At this time of fast-paced adoption, it is of utmost importance to analyze how well these technologies will scale as the number of devices connected to the Internet of Things inevitably grows. In this letter, we provide a stochastic geometry framework for modeling the performance of a single gateway LoRa network, a leading LPWA technology. Our analysis formulates the unique peculiarities of LoRa, including its chirp spread-spectrum modulation technique, regulatory limitations on radio duty cycle, and use of ALOHA protocol on top, all of which are not as common in today's commercial cellular networks. We show that the coverage probability drops exponentially as the number of end-devices grows due to interfering signals using the same spreading sequence. We conclude that this fundamental limiting factor is perhaps more significant toward LoRa scalability than for instance spectrum restrictions. Our derivations for co-spreading factor interference found in LoRa networks enables rigorous scalability analysis of such networks.},

First, we present the modeling of the network simulator. Then results for a critical case in the center of Paris show that, with meters all located deep indoor, the capacity of a network covering a dense urban area of 17 km 2 with 19 gateways distant from 1 km, considering only UL emissions, could be enough for an average targeted QoS of 98 {\%} as soon as there is no other traffic in the considered band. But we also show that we could very quickly reach the limits when considering that meters will not be the only LoRa devices communicating and above all considering the important impact of DL emissions on capacity.},
